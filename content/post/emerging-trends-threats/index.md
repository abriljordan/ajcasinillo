# Emerging Cyber threats of 2024

Several new trends and evolving techniques in cyber threats, particularly around ransomware, trojans, and hacking, are emerging in 2024:

## Ransomware Sophistication

Attackers are shifting from full encryption to intermittent encryption, encrypting portions of files at a time to evade detection and speed up attacks. Ransomware groups are also using quantum-resilient encryption methods, making recovery more difficult. Moreover, data theft and exfiltration are becoming primary tactics, with attackers stealing sensitive data and threatening to publish it unless a ransom is paid. Groups like CL0P and BlackCat have embraced this approach, often targeting cloud infrastructure, industrial systems, and managed service providers.

## Trojans and Virus Evolution

Cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting software vulnerabilities and stolen credentials, especially through phishing and brute-force attacks on Remote Desktop Protocols (RDP). Viruses are often delivered through trojans disguised as legitimate software or updates, which then facilitate deeper access into networks.

## Hacking Techniques

Several techniques are gaining prominence:
		
* DLL Sideloading and “Living off the Land” techniques are becoming more common, where attackers use legitimate tools or processes within the system to avoid detection.
	
* Supply chain attacks and phishing campaigns are expanding in scope, especially targeting companies’ cloud services and critical infrastructure ￼ ￼.

These developments point to a more professionalized and automated cybercrime ecosystem, requiring stronger defenses such as multi-factor authentication, timely patching, and regular backups to mitigate risks.
